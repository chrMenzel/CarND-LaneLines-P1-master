**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I applied Gaussion smoothing before
using Canny edge detection, which is useful to get an image of edges. I continued to define a region of interest in the
edges-image from the Canny edge detection because the lane lines should be in the bottom of the picture. After that
I applied Hough detection to find the relevant lines in the region of interest.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by extrapolating the
lines from the Hough detection. I separated these line dependent from their slope to the left or the right lane. After that the
x and y coordinates for the lines are calculated and the whole line is plotted.

Here are 2 images after the addition of the red lane lines:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when the road is not only straight on and has curves. You can see this in the last video
test_images_output/challenge.mp4. Another problem might come up when the car drives on roads without lane lines, which exist very often in villages or in the mountains. And driving in the night or another wheather than a sunny day may also be a problem.

Another shortcoming could be the line detection itself: I have seperated the right and left lane just according to the the slope of the line (negative = left lane, positive = right lane).


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to think about more conditions to choose the correct respectable lines from the Hough detection in order to get a better accuracy.

Another potential improvement could be to use the single frames in the video (maybe the last second). With the history of these pictures the accuracy could be improved.
