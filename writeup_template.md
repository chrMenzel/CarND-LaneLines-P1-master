**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I applied Gaussion smoothing before
using Canny edge detection, which is useful to get an image of edges. I continued to define a region of interest in the
edges-image from the Canny edge detection because the lane lines should be in the bottom of the picture. After that
I applied Hough detection to find the relevant lines in the region of interest.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by extrapolating the
lines from the Hough detection. I separated these line dependent from their slope to the left or the right lane. After that the
x and y coordinates for the lines are calculated and the whole line is plotted.

Here are 2 images after the addition of the red lane lines:
